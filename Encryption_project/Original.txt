To build trust with your budgie, spend time near its cage while talking to it softly, and place your hand inside with a treat like millet to encourage it to come to you willingly. Be patient, use gentle movements, and avoid chasing or grabbing the bird, as this can cause it to lose trust. Positive reinforcement through treats and a calm demeanor are key to building a long-term bond.
